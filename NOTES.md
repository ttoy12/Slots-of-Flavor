Backend Recommendation
Given your limited experience with backend development, I recommend starting with Firebase or Serverless Functions. Both options provide a simpler setup and reduce the need for extensive backend management:

Firebase is excellent if you want an all-in-one solution with built-in authentication and real-time database capabilities.
Serverless Functions are great if you prefer a more integrated approach with your Next.js deployment and want to avoid managing servers.
Both solutions will allow you to focus more on building features and less on managing infrastructure, making them suitable choices for someone with limited backend experience.

Firebase native mode recommended by chatgpt for storage.
